Hypothesis: Cancerous tumors that metastasize to a region have a similar metabolic profile to healthy cells in that region.
Null Hypothesis: Cancerous tumors that metastasize to a region will not have a similar metabolic profile to healthy cells in that region


Claims: Metasasized cancer cells have the same genetic profile as healthy cells. 
    -Issues: probably not true, and we probably know that this isnt true.
Claims: Healthy cells at the site will have high gene expression for certain metabolic functions. By the null hypothesis, cancerous cells probably won't.
Claims: Cancer cells that metastasize to different regions have different gene expression









Null Hypothesis: 




Steps
Acquire positive classes and negative classes, collate into one dataset

Transform all data (standardized log value)
(Log transformation is log_2(x+1) )
